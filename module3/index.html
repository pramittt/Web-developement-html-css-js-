    <p id="top">CHICKEN</p>
    Chickens are classified by their principal products into egg, dual-purpose (meat and eggs), and meat breeds. 
    Each has specific anatomical and physiological characteristics. 
    Laying hens are small, grow rapidly, and mature early. 
    The meat and dual-purpose breeds are larger, have well-developed muscles, and mature later.
    Roosters develop bony processes, spurs, on the lower part of the metatarsus. 
    Both hens and roosters have crests, which come in such shapes as leaf (with several teeth), rose, and pea. 
    Hens of egg breeds most commonly have leaf crests, which fall to the side at the second or third tooth. 
    The beak is slightly curved. 
    In most breeds, the beak and metatarsus are the same color: yellow, pale pink, black, and so on. 
    Plumage color varies.
    Hens of egg breeds weigh 1.8–2.2kg and roosters, 2.7–3.0kg; of dual-purpose breeds, 
    2.5–3.0kg and 3.5–4.0kg; and of meat breeds, 3.0–3.5kg and 3.5–4.5kg. Chicks at birth weigh 30–35g. 
    Chicks of dual-purpose breeds at 70–80 days usually weigh 20–30 percent more than those of egg breeds. 
    Broilers attain a weight of 1.5–1.6kg by 60–65 days of age. The white meat of broilers is a dietetic product; 
    it contains over 20 percent complete proteins and only 5–7 percent fat.
    Hens reach sexual maturity (age at the time of laying the first egg) at five or six months. 
    Birds of egg breeds mature earlier than those of dual-purpose breeds. Annual production of layers is 200–220 eggs and at the best purebred farms, 220–250 (the record is 365). The highest egg production is found in crossbred and interlineal hybrid birds selected for egg productivity and egg quality. A hen’s early eggs weigh 40–50 g; by the age of one year she lays eggs weighing 55–65 g. Hens of dual-purpose breeds lay smaller eggs than those of laying breeds. Egg laying ceases in hens with the onset of molting, which in good layers lasts for two to three weeks and two months or more in poor ones. 
    After molting, hens resume laying if feeding and maintenance conditions are good.
